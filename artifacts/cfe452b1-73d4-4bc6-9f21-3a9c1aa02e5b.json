I understand you want to replace the iframe link, but I need user notes to generate the HTML components. The iframe link you provided will be handled by the template system when it replaces the `{{ IFRAME_LINK }}` placeholder.

Could you please provide the user notes that describe:
- Project/website details and branding
- Content requirements (headlines, features, links, etc.)
- Design and color preferences (theme)

Once you provide these notes, I'll generate the JSON object with the populated HTML components for the style, wireframe, and footer sections.
